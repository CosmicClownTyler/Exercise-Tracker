# Exercise-Tracker

This is an app for tracking situps automatically using device sensors. 
Just orient the device properly and tap start, and begin your situps; the app will track them for you. 

To run this app, you can use the expo link provided in the assignment submission page (also provided here at the bottom), 
or you can install the necessary dependencies using your package manager, and then run the app using `npm run start`. 

Due to issues with Expo changes, I created a new Expo Project before submission, which are what these links point to. 
They work on my devices, so they should work for you no problem.
